# Bank-Term-Deposit-Predictor
Goal is to predict if a client will subscribe a term deposit (variable y in dataset).

### Attribute Information:
#### Bank client data:
* Age (numeric)
* Job : type of job (categorical: 'admin.', 'blue-collar', 'entrepreneur', 'housemaid', 'management', 'retired', 'self-employed', 'services', 'student', 'technician', 'unemployed', 'unknown')
* Marital : marital status (categorical: 'divorced', 'married', 'single', 'unknown' ; note: 'divorced' means divorced or widowed)
* Education (categorical: 'basic.4y', 'basic.6y', 'basic.9y', 'high.school', 'illiterate', 'professional.course', 'university.degree', 'unknown')
* Default: has credit in default? (categorical: 'no', 'yes', 'unknown')
* Housing: has housing loan? (categorical: 'no', 'yes', 'unknown')
* Loan: has personal loan? (categorical: 'no', 'yes', 'unknown')
#### Related with the last contact of the current campaign:
* Contact: contact communication type (categorical:
'cellular','telephone')
* Month: last contact month of year (categorical: 'jan', 'feb', 'mar',
â€¦, 'nov', 'dec')
* Dayofweek: last contact day of the week (categorical:
'mon','tue','wed','thu','fri')
* Duration: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important
note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if
duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call
is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known.
Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and
should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic
predictive model.
#### Other attributes:

this client (numeric, includes last contact)
* Pdays: number of days that passed by after the client was last
contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not
previously contacted)
* Previous: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for
this client (numeric)
* Poutcome: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical:
'failure','nonexistent','success')
